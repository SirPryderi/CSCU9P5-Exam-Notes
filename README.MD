# System and Software Engineering

## Why Software Engineering?
- Building large systems
- Understanding requirements
- Modelling the problem
    - Real world
      - Environment where the system operates
    - Problem domain
      - Concepts from the real world relevant to the requirements
    - Solution domain
      - Concepts from the problem domain relevant to the solution
- Dividing the problem

## Software Development Life Cycles

All Software development life cycles share these steps:
  - Requirements
    - Understand what the the client or the users want
    - Often they do not know what they want
    - Often the clients are not the end users
    - Build early prototypes to better understand the user requirements
  - Analysis
    - Identify what is going to be implemented
    - Identify the major components of the system
  - Design
    - Identify major components
    - Decompose major components into subsystems
    - Interface major components with subsystems
  - Implementation
  - Testing
  - Maintenance
