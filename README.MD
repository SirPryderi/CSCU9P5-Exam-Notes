# System and Software Engineering

## Why Software Engineering?
- Building large systems
- Understanding requirements
- Modelling the problem
    - Real world
      - Environment where the system operates
    - Problem domain
      - Concepts from the real world relevant to the requirements
    - Solution domain
      - Concepts from the problem domain relevant to the solution
- Dividing the problem

## Software Development Life Cycles

All Software development life cycles share these steps:
  - Requirements
    - Understand what the the client or the users want
    - Often they do not know what they want
    - Often the clients are not the end users
    - Build early prototypes to better understand the user requirements
  - Analysis
    - Identify what is going to be implemented
    - Identify the major components of the system
  - Design
    - Identify major components
    - Decompose major components into subsystems
    - Interface major components with subsystems
    - Identify new components to bridge the problem domain and the solution domain
  - Implementation
    - Code the components devised in the design phase
    - Integration of the components
    - Deploy the new system
  - Testing
    - Check that a component acts according to the requirements
    - Check if the system matches the requirements specifications
    - Check if the system meets the clients' expectations
    - Check if the system meets the users' expectations
  - Maintenance
    - Solve any issue that arises
    - Add new features if required

## The Waterfall Methodology
![Waterfall Model][WaterfallModel]

Inherited from the real world engineering, it follows the steps mentioned above, assuming that every previous step has been completed with absolute success, but this is almost never the case in Software Engineering. It is rarely effective in real life.

## Boehm's Spiral Model
![Boehm's Spiral Model][BoehmSpiralModel]

Boehm's model is an risk-driven model that integrates risk management and incremental model. It tries to overcome the issues with the Waterfall model.


# Requirements Capture and Analysis

# Project management, Risk Management and Teamwork

# Legal, Social, Ethical and Professional Issues
